At the same time, Luban also supports popular message frameworks such as protobuf, flatbuffers, and msgpack.](/en/docs/beginner/generatecodeanddata)## [📄️ Integrate Luban To Your ProjectInstall dotnet SDK](/en/docs/beginner/integratetoproject)## [📄️ Runtime loading configurationWe have provided a large number of sample projects under Projects.](/en/docs/beginner/loadinruntime)## [📄️ Use Custom TypesIn practice, we often encounter situations where enumerations and custom structures need to be defined. Luban perfectly supports this feature.](/en/docs/beginner/usecustomtype)## [📄️ Use Container TypesContainers are also the most commonly used types.

For example, the item_id field must have a valid item table id. Luban supports comprehensive data validation.](/en/docs/beginner/usevalidator)## [📄️ Use Polymorphic typesNot all data structures are standardized and consistent. In complex Gameplay, there are often many types of buff effects, and the fields of each type are different.](/en/docs/beginner/usepolymorphismtype)## [📄️ Auto-Imported TablesEach new table requires adding an entry to tables.xlsx, which is quite tedious. In most cases, each Excel file corresponds to a single table, so it's possible to have the tool automatically add the table definition.](/en/docs/beginner/importtable)
